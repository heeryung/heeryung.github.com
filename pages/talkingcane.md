<h4> Summary </h4>
A white cane was redesigned into TalkingCane, an interactive instrument for communication between visually impaired people and the world. The research goal of this project is to facilitate bus usage by visually impaired and hence increase their ability to exercise their essential right of accessibility in their daily lives.

<h4> Research Motivation </h4>
<ul>
    <li> Most of transit applications do not provide interfaces for the visually impaired, which makes using those applications on the road risky to the visually impaired.
    </li>
<li> Transit applications often do not support communication between visually impaired users and the real surrounding environment.
    </li> 
</ul>

<ul>
    <li> A white cane communicating with the surrounding environment can be considered a solution.
    </li>
    <li> Communcation with impending surroundings will be acheived through reading RFID chips in the braille road blocks. RFID chip reader at the bottom of the white cane reads the information and tells users the exact information on the location of target place including bus stops. 
    </li>
    <li> TalkingCane will deliver the direction to users based on the GPS data, through vibraion. 
    </li>
</ul>
