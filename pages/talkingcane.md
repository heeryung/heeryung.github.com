TalkingCane



<h4> Summary </h4>
A white cane was redesigned into TalkingCane, an interactive instrument for communication between visually impaired people and the world. The research goal of this project is to facilitate bus usage by visually impaired and hence increase their ability to exercise their essential right of accessibility in their daily lives.

<h4> Keywords </h4>
accessibility, visually impaired; Assistive technology; Public data usage; Public transportation

<h4> Research methods </h4>
user-centered design

<h4> Publications </h4>
TalkingCane: Designing Interactive White Cane for Visually Impaired People's Bus Usage, <br>Je Seok Lee, <strong>Heeryung Choi</strong>, Joonhwan Lee <br> <em>MobileHCI 2015

<h4> Research Motivation </h4>
<ul>
    <li> Despite transit applications, using smartphones on the road itself is risky for visually impaired people.
    </li>
<li> Transit applications often do not support communication between visually impaired users and the real surrounding environment.
    </li> 
</ul>

<h4> Apporach </h4>

Kinetic typography refers to the technique of expression with animated text. Similar to the study of traditional typography of designing static typographic forms, kinetic typography focuses on understanding the effect time has on the expression of text. Kinetic typography has demonstrated the ability to add significant emotive content and appeal to expressive text, allowing some of the qualities normally found in film and the spoken word to be added to static text. Kinetic type has been widely and successfully used in film as well as in television and computer-based advertising. Perceptual psychology research on attention, reading performance, and comprehension has indicated that time-based presentation of text can be used effectively to capture and manipulate a viewer’s attention and in some cases improve overall reading performance.
