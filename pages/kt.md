<h4> Summary </h4>
KIWEE(Kinetic typography Instant messenger With Emotional Expression) allows users to automatically create kinetic typography effect, encouraging deliver emotions through text. Kinetic typography(KT) enables users to better convey emotions in text-based communication. In this project, we propose a sentence-level KT system that generates and assigns effects to the text input. We believe that our system improves the utilization of KT for broader applications. The system consists of 5 steps, and we focused on creating an algorithm for automated processing and layout of text, as in a sentence.

<h4> Research Motivation </h4>
<ul>
    <li> To develop sentence-level . </li>
    <li> To build an <strong>automatic</strong> KT generator in order to faciliate more end users applying KT. </li>
    <li> To build a <strong>real-time</strong> KT generator in order to deliver emotion in CMC. </li>
</ul>


<h4> Preliminary Study </h4>
<ul>
    <li> Emotions were coded on the moods (positive/negative) - energy (arousal) dimension. </li>
    <li> <a href="Evaluating Pre-defined Kinetic Typography Effects to Convey Emotions">Preliminary research</a> findings indicate how mood and energy level can be represented through kinetic typography moods. </li>
    <li> Based on the KT effect library we build, the prototype for the KT system was established using JavaScript toolkits. </li>
