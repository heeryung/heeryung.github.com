<h4> Summary </h4>
KIWEE(Kinetic typography Instant messenger With Emotional Expression) allows users to automatically create kinetic typography effect, encouraging deliver emotions through text.</strong> Kinetic typography(KT) enables users to better convey emotions in text-based communication. In this project, we propose a sentence-level KT system that generates and assigns effects to the text input. We believe that our system improves the utilization of KT for broader applications. The system consists of 5 steps, and we focused on creating an algorithm for automated processing and layout of text, as in a sentence.

<div>

Kinetic typography refers to the technique of expression with animated text. Similar to the study of traditional typography of designing static typographic forms, kinetic typography focuses on understanding the effect time has on the expression of text. Kinetic typography has demonstrated the ability to add significant emotive content and appeal to expressive text, allowing some of the qualities normally found in film and the spoken word to be added to static text. Kinetic type has been widely and successfully used in film as well as in television and computer-based advertising. Perceptual psychology research on attention, reading performance, and comprehension has indicated that time-based presentation of text can be used effectively to capture and manipulate a viewer’s attention and in some cases improve overall reading performance.
