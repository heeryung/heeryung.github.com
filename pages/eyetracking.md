<p> In spite of its cutting-edge internet technology and fast-developed internet culture, online news website in South Korea still seems to be out-dated or under-developed in terms of UX design; most of media companies have no consideration on readibility and cover an article page with assorted advertisements. While many media companies obssess on earning money from ads, readability has beed dropped and even ads seems to be ignored by users who have been fed up with them. The issue has been criticized for several years (http://ppss.kr/archives/28531, http://ppss.kr/archives/18027). We measured readers' eye-gaze duration, pixels for each element (text articles, ads and navigation), and visualize how much ads occupy an article page, and how much readers are distracted due to unorganized UX design.</p>
