          <p>
            I am a learning science researcher, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota with Profs. Panayiota Kendeou and Caitlin Mills. I earned my PhD in Information from the University of Michigan under the supervision of Prof. Christopher Brooks.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            My work focuses on optimizing educational technology to be more human-centered, grounded in self-regulated learning theory. I use mixed methods, experiments, statistical analyses, and machine learning to investigate how technology can support learners’ agency and metacognition.
          </p>
        
          <p>Recently, my research has centered on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Promoting learner agency through human–AI interaction in educational settings</li>
            <li>Designing and validating multimodal learning trace data for a richer understanding of motivation and engagement</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>
            Outside of research, I enjoy taking walks while listening to K-pop.
