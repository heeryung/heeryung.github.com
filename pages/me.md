            <b><i>I am a learning science researcher focusing on optimizing educational technology to be more human-centered, grounded in self-regulated learning theory.</i></b>. I earned my PhD in Information from the University of Michigan under the supervision of Prof. Christopher Brooks.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            I use mixed methods, experimental designs, statistical analyses, and machine learning to examine how technology can enhance learners’ agency and metacognition in today’s educational landscape.
          </p>
        
          <p>My recent research includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Advancing learner agency through human–AI interaction in digital educational environments</li>
            <li>Designing and validating research methods to measure adjustments in learner achievement motivation using trace data</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>
            Outside of research, I enjoy taking walks while listening to K-pop and audiobooks.
